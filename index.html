        <p>
            I'm the founder of Hack Club, where our mission is to help as many teenagers as possible fall in love with computers and electronics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up, I was incredibly lucky to discover computers as tools for creation. Learning to code completely changed my life, and made me feel like I had finally found a tool to express myself. Now, I'm lucky enough to help others on that same journey.

            The lack of CSS is intentional.
