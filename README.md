# Zach's Elegant Tech Website

This is a personal website project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase a modern, elegant, and tech-inspired aesthetic, reminiscent of Apple and Google Gemini's design language.

## Features

*   **Glassmorphism Effect:** A sleek, transparent "glass" card effect for the main content.
*   **Dynamic Gradient Background:** A vibrant, animated gradient inspired by Google Gemini's color palette.
*   **Interactive Tech Pattern:** Subtle, animated tech-themed patterns in the background.
*   **Typing Effect Title:** The main heading animates as if being typed.
*   **Customizable Cursor:** An elegant, interactive cursor that changes appearance based on theme and hover states.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Switch between a light and a dark mode.
*   **3D Hover Effects:** The content card subtly transforms in 3D when hovered over.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (though primarily optimized for desktop).
*   **Git Version Control:** Project managed with Git, hosted on GitHub.
